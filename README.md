## Overview

### The challenge

In this practice the card must be able to adjust its size depending on the width of the device where it is viewed.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- @Font-face
- Modern CSS Reset (Piccadilli)

### What I learned

Instead of changing the width of the card using media queries, it was allowed to scale its size freely, limiting its max-width at rem.

### Continued development

Continue learning about:

- Accesibility
- Rem/ems units
